                    <p>In this program, we compete annually in the <a href="https://www.firstinspires.org/robotics/frc">FIRST Robotics Competition</a>, commonly referred to as FRC. For those unfamiliar with the program, every team around the world recieves the game rules simultaneously in early January. Each game is different from year to year, and no game has ever been repeated. From moment the rules are released, teams have 6 weeks to design, build, and program a robot to compete in that year's game. At the end of the 6 weeks, the robot is placed in a giant plastic bag, and remains untouched until competition. During competition, teams face off in <span style="display: inline-block">3 vs. 3</span> matches. The competitions begin with qualifier matches where teams are assigned opponents and teammates randomly. Once those are completed, the top 8 teams each select 2 other teams to compete in finals. Finals are still <span style="display: inline-block">3 vs. 3,</span> but the remaining teams compete in a traditional bracket style tournament, with the 3 winning teams being declared the winner.</p>
                    <p>The team is open to any high school age resident of Iredell County in North Carolina. No prior skills are required as a major focus of the team is to provide robotics experiences to anyone interested. It should be noted that while this team is an ongoing commitment, the largest time commitment is between the months of January to March, as that is when the robot is built and brought to competition.</p>
                    <p>The team is structured with traditional elected leadership positions including: President, Vice President of Internal Affairs, Vice President of External Affairs, Secretary, and Treasurer. Additionally, there are two leadership positions based on team safety, the Safety Captain and Emvironmental Health and Safety (EHS) Manager. Beyond leadership positions, the team is split into 3 main subteams. It should be noted that members are not strictly confined within one subteam and are free to work in multiple subteams. There are also some smaller subteams which are either very niche or specific to when the team is at competition</p>
                    <h1>Main Subteams</h1>
                    <h2>Mechanical</h2>
                    <p>In most teams, the mechanical subteam is generally responsible for the design and construction of the robot. We take a slightly different approach during the design process by involving all members regardless of specialization to ensure no idea goes without consideration. This approach is also used to make sure the robot is not only mechanically designed well, but easily wired and programmed as well. Once the robot design in ready, the mechanical team works to prototype the ideas and if successful, integrate them into the final product.</p>
                    <p>Members of this subteam traditionally have the following skills, but they are not required.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Power tool operation</li>
                        <li>Custom part fabrication</li>
                        <li>Knowledge of pneumatic systems</li>
                        <li>Knowledge of mechanical advantage</li>
                        <li>Optional: CAD Modeling</li>
                        <li>Optional: Sewing (Specifically with thick material)</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h2>Electrical</h2>
                    <p>The electrical team is, as the name implies, responsible for the eletrical components of the robot. This team is closely related with the programming and machanical, team and therefore sees a lot of crossover with members. In FRC, electrical work is not regulated to just power delivery, but data transmission as well, so members of this team should be familiar with both.</p>
                    <p>Members of this subteam traditionally have the following skills, but they are not required.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Use of common electrical tools (i.e. wire strippers)</li>
                        <li>Use of best practice with wiring</li>
                        <li>Knowledge of PWM and CAN data transfer methods</li>
                        <li>Knowledge of how electrical components interact with programs</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h2>Programming</h2>
                    <p>This team is responsible for programming the robot to ensure the drivers can efficiently and safely operate all functions of the robot in competition. Additionally, a 15 seconnd autonomous period is programmed for the start of every match. This team works very closely with both the electrical and mechanical teams to the details in the programs, such as port numbers, are correctly assigned. The team also works with the drivers to tune the controls to their preferences.</p>
                    <p>Members of this subteam traditionally have the following skills, but they are not required.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Knowledge of the Java programming language</li>
                        <li>Knowledge of the <a href="https://first.wpi.edu/FRC/roborio/release/docs/java/">WPI Library</a> (Specific to FRC)</li>
                        <li>Knowledge of PWM and CAN data transfer methods</li>
                        <li>Knowledge in Trigonometry and optionally, Calculus</li>
                        <li>Knowledge in PID systems</li>
                        <li>Knowledge in autonomous operation</li>
                        <li>Knowledge in wireless remote operation (If you consider about 20 yards remote)</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h1>Minor Subteams</h1>
                    <h2>Drive Team</h2>
                    <p>As the name says, this team is responsible for the operation of the robot at competiton. The team consists of a main driver, co-driver, human player, technician, and coach. When public demonstrations or classes are held by the team, either the main driver or co-driver will drive the robot.</p>
                    <h2>Safety Team</h2>
                    <p>This team consists of the Safety Captain and EHS Manager. While we encourage all members to be safe, the members of this subteam are tasked with enforcing safety regulations and maintaining a safe environment.</p>
